This Java project contains some implementations of the Minimum Dominanting Set Algorithms

There are 4 packages:

1-exactalgorithm: contains the exacts solutions algorithms.

2-graph: for the data structure representation of the graph.

3-heuristics: contains the class responsible for the heuristics solutions.

4-util: some utilities classes used by this project.



Every package contains a info.txt that has more details about the given package.

To run the implemented algorithms  a mds.jar is located in the same directory as this readMe file.

For detailled information wich parameters to give,
plase refer to the main method of "\src\main\java\umons\algorithm\dominatingset\Run.java" classs.
