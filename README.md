This Java project contains some implementations of the Minimum Dominanting Set Algorithms

There are 4 packages:

1-exactalgorithm: contains the exacts solutions algorithms.

2-graph: for the data structure representation of the graph.

3-heuristics: contains the class responsible for the heuristics solutions.

4-util: some utilities classes used by this project.

To run the implemented algorithms  a jar file (mds.jar) is located in the same directory as this README file.


For detailled information hwo to run the jar file, plase refer to the main method of the class "\src\main\java\umons\algorithm\dominatingset\Run.java".
